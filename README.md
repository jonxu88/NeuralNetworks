# NeuralNetworks

Some code that I've written regarding Neural Networks, in order to understand them.

** UnderstandingBackpropogation3.py **
Coded backpropogration for one input layer with two neurons,
one output layer with one neuron, and no bias or activation functions.

** RecurrentNeuralNetworkCryptocurrency.py **
Cryptocurrency price prediction model, using a recurrent neural network.
Based on the previous 60 minutes of the price of a cryptocurrency, determine its price in 3 minutes.
Therefore, determine a buy/not buy strategy.
This code follows Sentdex's tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne-dpRdNReI

** UnderstandingBackpropogation.py **
I coded the backpropogation for the simplest neural network.
There is only one input layer (with one neuron),
one output layer with one neuron, and no bias or activation function.

** UnderstandingBackpropogation2.py **
Includes bias.

** UnderstandingBackpropogation2wSigmoid.py **
Include bias and a sigmoid activation function.
