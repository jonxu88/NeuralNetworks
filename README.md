# NeuralNetworks

Some code that I've written regarding Neural Networks, in order to understand them.

** UnderstandingBackpropogation.py **
I coded the backpropogation for the simplest neural network.
There is only one input layer (with one neuron),
one output layer with one neuron, and no bias or activation function.

** UnderstandingBackpropogation2.py **
Include bias.

** UnderstandingBackpropogation2wSigmoid.py **
Include bias and a sigmoid activation function.
